</font><font size="2" color="EE269F">

Q:  Are you a cult?<br><br>
<b>
A:  Yes, as a matter of fact.  In short, the New Society is a substandard<br>
cult with the aspirations of attaining its goal of "The New Society" and<br>
thusforth overachieving its expectations.<br><br></b>
Q:  What is your goal?<br><br>
<b>
A:  The New Society has several missions to achieve the elusive Common<br>
Goal.  First and foremost, billions of acres of rain forest are currently<br>
plaguing this Earth with a highly flammable, polluting substance known as<br>
O2, or oxygen.  This element is easily ignited, and allows other polluting<br>
substances, such as smog, to latch onto its molecules and thusforth, smother<br>
the inhabitants of the Earth.  Our mission is to prove that we can do without<br>
this horrid element, as we have developed a so-called "cocktail" of Unununium<br>
and Nitrogen which will take its place.  As we continue to burn acres of the<br>
rain forests on Bolivian soil, we are reaching our goal faster than ever.<br><br></b>
Q:  But isn't Unununium a synthetic solid element?<br><br>
<b>
A:  Why, of course.<br><br></b>
Q:  And is Nitrogen not a highly flammable substance which is used often in<br>
combustible fuel compounds, and cause of a condition of blood poisioning <br>
known as "the bends" in humans?<br><br>
<b>
A:  Eh, Shut up.<br><br></b>
Q:  And your other missions?<br><br>
<b>
A:  Well, I should say, or perhaps shouldn't, that the cause of much of our<br>
misfortunes can be rooted in the fact that "my D's are numbered" and<br>
I would LOVE to explain this now, but I got works to do.  Top of the day<br>
to ya!<br><br></b>
